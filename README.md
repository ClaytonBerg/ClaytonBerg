## Hi there 👋

<!--
**ClaytonBerg/ClaytonBerg** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m working on atomic physics and quantum optics research over the summer at Lake Forest College.
- 🌱 I’m learning statistical programming with R, real analysis, classical mechanics, thermodynamics, and beginning Python.
- 📫 How to reach me: bergclo33@lakeforest.edu
